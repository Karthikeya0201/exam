i m workig on a new feature, instead of directly starting with a new branch, i make a copy of code and work on there. Later, when i try to integrate my changes into main line, git refuses to do a fast forward merge and reports confllict,.Resolve
i keep main branch as final source 
conflict is fiex and history shows the merge clearly
